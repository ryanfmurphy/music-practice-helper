## Planned Features

- [ ] Add a Song Builder page
- [ ] A measure-level "hide-to-memorize" flag
  - Since the measures are denoted by the measure boxes, what we want to hide
      is the sheet music directly below the measure box. You could have a blue dotted-lined-region that looks similar as the line-based one, but it comes straight down
      from the left and right of the measure box - no white space in between the measure box and the "flag falling down and covering up that part of the sheet music. Same
      or similar messaging: "Play from memory <sparkle>"
- [ ] An option to toggle the hide-to-memorize for a line
- [ ] Store % widths for measure boxes on song_page_line, and display measure boxes with min-width: X%
  - Allows lining up with sheet music better
- [ ] Add bpm_denominator to measure_confidence. ENUM values = whole,half,quarter,dotted-quarter,8th,16th
- [ ] Allow deleting a measure's details
- [ ] ? Add "show_progress" toggle (when unchecked remove the measure boxes)
- [ ] Indicate editorially corrected music lines with üìù and allow switching back to the original with üîÑ


- [x] Add "facing_pages" toggle (allow larger 1-page mode)
- [x] Dark mode
- [x] Keep history of past measure details (in separate table)

## Style tweaks

- [ ] Make Dark Mode look nicer
- [x] Lighten the border and number color of un-detailed measures (gray)
